<p>In 2013 I created <a href="http://tweetwall.nypl.org">tweetwall.nypl.org</a>. It was a way to view Twitter through the lens of library collections. It displayed tweets that matched a certain format and contained links to library web properties, and contextualized them with image thumbnails. It used <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry</a>, and <a href="http://glyphicons.com/">GLYPHICONS</a>. The source is archived on <a href="https://github.com/lolibrarian/nypl-tweetwall">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>My goal was to put the content item at the center of the conversation.  Any tweets about that item, whether original statements, RTs (retweets), or replies containing the link, appear underneath. You can click on any link &mdash; to the item, the user, or the tweet, to see more.</p>
<p>I originally wrote about this project the week DOMA was overturned. <a href="/assets/Screen-Shot-2013-06-26-at-8.20.40-PM.png"><img src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2013-06-26-at-8.20.40-PM.png" alt="Tweetwall Images" /></a> </p>
