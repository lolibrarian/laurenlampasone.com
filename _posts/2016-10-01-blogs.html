<p>I helped to launch and supported the library’s blogging program from its beginning in 2008 until 2016. As a reference librarian and budding "digital producer" I taught library workers the tools and skills they needed to get their collections knowledge out onto the internet where it could be discovered by search engines and put to use by readers in New York and around the world. </p>
<p>As soon as I started my career in 2004 I began to witness the rapid evolution of reference work and information seeking behavior. More and more readers and researchers were gathering online, and by prioritizing access and education, libraries were working hard to close the digital divide. In addition to supporting the virtual reference team, I also helped to kickstart the library's social media presence in 2008 and formation of an online recommendation and readers' advisory service in 2013.</p>

<p>My vision for the blog was as a vibrant and diverse community that reflected our values and presented information clearly and accessibly, with citations and referrals to library collections. I also read (and responded to) comments! Being able to spark moments of connection, whether online or in person, is one of the most rewarding parts of library work.</p>
