<p>Since June 2018 a colleague and I have been hosting a monthly Death Cafe using the model put forth by <a href="https://deathcafe.com/">Jon Underwood and Sue Barsky Reid</a>. It is a way to bring together people of all ages, genders, races, cultural backgrounds, abilities, and religious traditions to talk honestly about our lives, our hopes, and our fears. Rather than morbid or dark, past conversations have been uplifting and thought-provoking. Placing Death Cafe in a library setting means that we have thousands of books and other materials at hand to guide us in our search for meaning and to recommend to each other.</p>
